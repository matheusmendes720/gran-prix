Should I create a consolidated "Global Constraints" document that all clusters reference, or keep it embedded in each cluster document as shown above?

Next steps:
1. Save the Global Constraints document
2. Update all 5 cluster documents with the constraint sections
3. Update the diagnostic document
4. Review Dockerfiles and requirements.txt files
5. Add validation checks to CI/CD pipelines

Should I create validation scripts to automatically check for ML dependencies in Dockerfiles and requirements.txt files?
