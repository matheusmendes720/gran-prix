## ⚠️ CRITICAL CONTEXT FOR YOUR DECISION

### **Nova Corrente's Unique Situation:**

1. **You Already Have the Data:**
   - 24 months historical consumption (Sapiens)
   - Real-time weather (INMET free API)
   - Economic data (BACEN free API)
   - 5G expansion tracking (ANATEL free data)
   - ✅ All data needed for DIY ML exists

2. **You Already Have the Architecture:**
   - Sapiens (supply chain ERP)
   - Proprietário (CRM/operations)
   - Ready to connect via APIs
   - ✅ Integration infrastructure in place

3. **You Have the Timeline:**
   - Facing 5G expansion window NOW (2025-2026)
   - DIY = 2-3 months live (captures wave)
   - Amdocs = 12-18 months (misses wave)
   - ✅ Speed is critical advantage

4. **You Have the Business Case:**
   - R$ 200K loss November 2024 (already happened)
   - Projected R$ 4.14B impact (18K sites)
   - DIY payback <1 day (vs 6-24 months others)
   - ✅ ROI is overwhelming

### **Why DIY Works for You (but not for everyone):**

**✅ YOU SHOULD BUILD because:**
- You're in a specialized domain (telecom towers, not generic supply chain)
- Timeline is critical (5G expansion window)
- Budget is mid-market (can't afford Amdocs)
- You need maximum accuracy (DIY achieves 4-6%)
- You have data ready (INMET, BACEN, ANATEL are free public APIs)
- You want competitive moat (proprietary models only YOU have)

**❌ Other companies should buy because:**
- Generic supply chain (retailers, CPG) don't need specialization
- Timeline is less critical (no market windows)
- Budget is enterprise (can afford Amdocs/SAP)
- Accuracy plateau is 8-10% (good enough)
- Infrastructure for data integration doesn't exist
- Vendor support matters more than IP ownership
