Briefly, hES (H9) and hiPSCs (KOLF2.1) underwent mesodermal induction via embryoid body formation, followed by hemogenic endothelium induction and myeloid differentiation to generate primitive monocyte-like precursors. These precursors were then matured into microglia by supplementing with key neuron-derived factors that promote microglial identity, thereby recapitulating human microglia in monoculture.
