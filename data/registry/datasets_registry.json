These precursors were then matured into microglia by supplementing with key neuron-derived factors that promote microglial identity, thereby recapitulating human microglia in monoculture.

      "description": "<p>We constructed the most comprehensive dataset of nominal catches from global tuna fisheries by compiling and harmonizing public domain data from the five tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (t-RFMOs) for the period 1918-2023. Under the auspices of the Fisheries and Resources Monitoring System (FIRMS) of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),we developed a systematic data flow process in collaboration with the t-RFMO Secretariats. This process involved the implementation of a data exchange format adhering to the standards of the FAO Coordinating Working Party on Fishery Statistics (CWP),facilitating the seamless integration of data into the dataset.<br><br>Nominal catch data are expressed in live-weight equivalent (metric tonnes) and primarily represent the quantities of retained fish either landed or transhipped at sea and in ports. In recent years,data from fisheries in the Atlantic and Western-Central Pacific Oceans have partially included amounts of fish discarded dead. The data are stratified by year,fishing fleet,fishing gear,large spatial area,and taxon.<br><br>The dataset encompasses 50 medium- and large-sized pelagic species found in both neritic and oceanic habitats of the world's oceans. This includes 15 species of tunas,10 species of billfish,8 species of Spanish mackerels,2 species of bonitos,and wahoo. In 2023,the global catch for these species was estimated to exceed 6.4 million metric tonnes. Despite uncertainties and incomplete data due to under-reporting,the dataset also includes reported catches for 14 species of pelagic sharks and rays that may be either targeted or incidentally caught in tuna and tuna-like fisheries. The total reported catch of these elasmobranch species was approximately 154,000 metric tonnes in 2023.<br><br>The dataset serves as a benchmark for the monitoring and assessment of both artisanal and industrial fisheries from over 161 fishing fleets across 159 countries that have exploited tuna and tuna-like species for subsistence and commercial purposes over more than seven decades.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Poor quality project delivery is major problems that face the Nigeria construction industry. It&rsquo;s of high concern to those who are involved in the construction industry. This study was carried out to identify the major causes of poor quality project delivery in Nigeria building construction industry, by means of a literature review and a questionnaire survey. A total of fifty (50) poor quality causative factors were obtained from literature. The questionnaire survey was distributed to randomly selected respondents from a combination of clients, consultants, contractors, site-engineers, project-managers and sub-contractors. In all, one hundred and forty one (141) questionnaires were distributed to randomly selected respondents (clients, consultants, contractors, site-engineers, project-managers and subcontractors), one hundred and thirty two (132) questionnaires were returned out of which three (3) questionnaires were found incomplete and invalid. Only one hundred and twenty nine (129) questionnaires were found consistent and valid for use in this research. Relative Importance Index (RII) and Severity Index were used to carry out ranking analysis. Based on the data received, the most severe factors affecting project quality in Nigeria construction industries are: construction mistakes, use of inexperienced labours, poor checking and inspection, Poor motivation System (incentives), Poor management commitment and leadership styles, Unavailability of good quality construction materials, Limitation of finance and budget, Inadequate timely supervision among others. Their severity ranges from 89.4% to 80.5%.</p>\n<p>Cite this article: Dorcas,O.A.B., Elkanah, A.O., &amp; Omolayo, O.J. (2019).

      "url": "",
      "description": "<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>The dataset includes distance and angle measurements obtained from a hybrid localization system integrated with the IEEE 802.15.4 Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) protocol [1]. The system combines multi-carrier phase difference (MCPD) or phase-based ranging (PBR) for distance estimation [2] with phase-based direction finding technique for angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation [3], enabling hybrid localization using a single anchor node in an IoT network.</p>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n<p>The measurements were collected in an office environment with a IEEE 802.15.4 TSCH network formed by six low-cost devices. One node, positioned in the center of a 5.1 m by 6.5 m room, acted as the root and performed localization of five surrounding nodes. Each device was built upon the AT86RF215 transceiver, which provides access to the phase of the received signal. To enable angle estimation, the root node was equipped with an RF switch and a uniform circular antenna (UCA) array composed of eight dipole elements spaced equally across 360 degrees. The pictures of the setup, used equipment and configuration are attached in the dataset files along with detailed description.</p>\n<h2>Measurement Procedure</h2>\n<p>The root of the node first formed a TSCH network. When all devices joined the network, the root started acting as an initiator, pinging its child devices. Each packet transmission initiated a Phase Measurement Process (PMP) that acquired phase measurements for angle and distance estimation [1]. During each PMP, the initiator captured eight reference phase samples from the first antenna to estimate and correct the carrier frequency offset (CFO), followed by ninety phase samples across the antenna array for AoA estimation. The switching between antenna elements was performed in a Round Robin (RR) pattern. The sampling rate of the system was 8 us per phase sample [3]. For distance estimation, fifteen frequency samples were measured sequentially using the Golomb frequency set to minimize measurement time and spectral overlap [2].</p>\n<h3>Software&nbsp;Implementation</h3>\n<p>The software implementation of the modified Contiki-NG stack that supports hybrid localization alongside TSCH communication is available at: https://github.com/9morano/contiki-ng/tree/vesna-atasw</p>\n<h2>Dataset Structure</h2>\n<p>The dataset is stored in a single JSON file named `data.json`. It is organized by device, where each entry includes the device address and an array of records. Each record contains the absolute slot number (ASN) corresponding to the TSCH schedule, two arrays of phase samples representing measurements from the initiator and the reflector, an array of eight reference phase values used for frequency offset calibration, and a second array of ninety phase values used for angle estimation. The JSON file can be parsed using Python built-in json module.&nbsp;</p>",

A new PINE operation was started every 1-11 days, with the operation folder names labelled as the date the operation started in the YY/MM/DD format.</p>\n<p>The raw PINE data is provided here for each operation (\"operation setup\", \"raw_Data\", and Level 0 data (\"L0_Data\")). The raw data was processed using the PINE INP Analysis (PIA) software version 2.0.2 to derive time series data (Level 1, \"L1_Data\") and temperature spectra (Level 2, \"L2_Data\") of INP concentrations, as per B&uuml;ttner and F&ouml;sig (2023) (https://zenodo.org/records/15592786).

      "title": "Phase Measurements for AoA Estimation in IEEE 802.15.4 TSCH-based Networks",
      "url": "",
      "description": "<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>The dataset contains phase measurements for angle of arrival (AoA) estimation gathered during a controlled indoor line of sight experiment in a indoor hallway. The dataset was created as part of the study reported in paper [1], where AoA estimation was integrated into the IEEE 802.15.4 time slotted channel hopping (TSCH) protocol, enabling direction estimation alongside communication.</p>\n<p>The AoA can be estimated using multiple antennas spaced less than half a signal&rsquo;s wavelength apart. When the receiver (RX) is in the transmitter&rsquo;s (TX) far field, the signal arrives at each antenna with a phase difference that enables AoA estimation. The process of obtaining the phase from different antennas depends on the receiver architecture and antenna setup. Since IEEE 802.15.4 radios are typically low cost, low power, and low complexity, they use a single RF signal chain. To integrate localization functionality into the TSCH protocol, we use an antenna array with switching circuit to capture phase samples from multiple antennas, offering a low-cost and low-power localization solution for IoT systems [1].</p>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n<p>Measurements were performed in a 3 m &times; 60 m indoor hallway at the Jožef Stefan Institute. The campaign used off the shelf OpenMote-B devices with AT86RF215 radios connected to a host computer for processing. Radio nodes were placed on stands 1.6 m above the floor and separated by 3.5 m (confirmed with laser ranger). A dipole antenna was used at the reflector site and a circular antenna array [2] was used at the initiator site.</p>\n<h2>Measurement Procedure</h2>\n<p>The devices were running Contiki-NG OS with a modified protocol stack enabling phase measurement for AoA estimation, as presented in [1]. When a TSCH network is formed, the root of the network initiated channel measurements by sending data packets to the reflector node. After the data transmission, the initiator emitted continuous wave (CW) signal while the receiver sequentially hopped through different antennas and performed phase measurements of the received signal. Two switching patterns were employed: return-to-first (RTF) and Round Robin (RR), with a sampling rate of 8 us. Total of 90 samples was available for phase measurements, therefore in case of antenna array with 12 elements applying RR or RTF switching pattern, the number of samples per antenna is 7 and 4 respectively. Because low-cost radio hardware is used, the devices exhibit differences between their transmit and receive carrier frequencies, known as carrier frequency offset (CFO). Besides antenna phase samples, the device also obtained 8 phase samples from the first (reference) antenna, which can serve as a reference for CFO estimation and calibration.</p>\n<p>During the experimentation, the reflector remained stationary, while the initiator antenna was manually rotated around its Z-axis to acquire measurements at different angles, namely from: 0 to 330 degrees in step of 30 degrees. The devices used all available IEEE 802.15.4 frequency channels for communication and phase measurements.</p>\n<h3>Software Implementation</h3>\n<p>The software implementation of the modified Contiki-NG stack that&nbsp;supports phase measurement for AoA estimation is available at: https://github.com/9morano/contiki-ng/tree/openmote-aoa</p>\n<h2>Dataset Structure</h2>\n<p>Measurements are stored in two directories: one for RTF switch pattern and the other for RR switch pattern. Each dataset file (`*.json`) is structured as a single JSON object containing measurements from different angle setup. The JSON file can be parsed using Python built-in json module.&nbsp;</p>",

      "url": "",
      "description": "<p>This data archive includes data, R code, and model objects used to analyze drought-driven changes in the structure and composition of pinyon-juniper woodlands of northern Arizona, USA. The archive includes records of &gt;5,000 individual trees, which were repeatedly measured over the period of 1998 to 2023, as well as associated ground cover and field-derived soils information. Lastly, it includes downscaled climate data and other spatial datasets associated with the field sites. For additional details, see the \"README.html\" file in this archive. An abstract for this project is as follows:</p>\n<p>Global changes in temperature and aridity are increasing the frequency of extreme drought events. Such changes can have pronounced impacts on dryland ecosystems which exist at the margins of plant physiological tolerances. Pinyon-juniper (PJ) woodlands &ndash; a dryland vegetation type spanning 40 million ha in western North America &ndash; is a model system for the impacts of drought, where recurrent short-interval drought events may trigger feedback mechanisms that influence future drought resistance. Leveraging a long-term monitoring network in PJ woodlands of the United States (US) Southwest, we sought to understand how interactions between recurrent drought events influence tree mortality risk. We developed generalized linear mixed models to predict patterns of recent (i.e., 2014-2023) tree mortality based on biophysical variables, tree size, and prior drought-driven changes (ca. 1998-2014) in forest conditions. We then used these models to quantify how mortality risk has shifted over time. Tree density and stand basal area declined substantially throughout our 1998 to 2023 monitoring period. Since 2014, tree mortality was more common and spatially extensive than new tree recruitment, and nearly half of the surviving trees experienced crown dieback. Tree size influenced biotic interactions and responses to environmental conditions, and soil organic matter and mycorrhizal fungi communities buffered individuals against drought. Shifts in woodland demographics (e.g., reduced stand densities, crown dieback) led to a 30% relative increase in mortality risk between 2014 and 2023 for trees that survived this period. Recent drought events have triggered widespread tree mortality and dieback in PJ woodlands of the US Southwest. These events are also increasing future tree mortality risk, overcoming system inertia created by local edaphic conditions and compensatory responses.</p>",

      "description": "<p>This dataset comprises multiple years of heating system data in multi-family homes in Lower Saxony.</p>\n<p>The buildings are 34 multi-family homes with central heating, primarily heated by gas boilers with some alternatives being included. Most of them have a central domestic hot water system as well. The sample covers a large range of buildings from small (4 housing units) to large (47 housing units), old (built in 1931) to new (built in 2017), and across multiple other variables.</p>\n<p>The measurements were conducted in the central heating and cover inlet and outlet temperatures, water mass flow rates, and resulting energy production/demand for each and every heat generator or consumer in a given building. The dataset is supported by weather data sourced from the German weather service (DWD) and detailed metadata on the buildings.</p>\n<p>It covers 4 heating periods from late 2020 to early 2024 in time steps of one minute with a total data availability of 82%. For 32 buildings, at least one heat period has over 99% availability.</p>\n<p>The small version omits temperatures and water flows, focusing on the energy flows exclusively.</p>\n<p>The HDF5 format allows the packaging of multiple data feeds into one large file, together with relevant metadata. A viewing application and libraries to handle the files are available online, though for anyone that does not want to use HDF5, we provide python code in our git that extracts all the data into .csv files under https://git.isfh.de/extern/FeBOp.</p>\n<p>More information on the underlying research project can be found here: https://isfh.de/en/projects/febop-mfh</p>\n<p>If you have any questions or suggestions, please reach out to us as we will continuously improve upon the dataset to make it as useful and easy to use for the community as possible.</p>",

Aerosol was sampled through a heated total suspended particulate (TSP) sampling head at a flow rate of 33.33 L/min and into the IcePod laboratory, where the sampled air was split into four lines to monitor aerosols using multiple instruments; PINE was connected to one of these lines and operated at a flow rate of 2 L/min. Data was collected from 7th October 2021 to 16th February 2022. A new PINE operation was started every 1-11 days, with the operation folder names labelled as the date the operation started in the YY/MM/DD format.</p>\n<p>The raw PINE data is provided here for each operation (\"operation setup\", \"raw_Data\", and Level 0 data (\"L0_Data\")).
